                    <p class="lh-base">A Student Management System is a major software solution that helps with everything 
                        from admissions to student success. It facilitates and manages key administrative processes, maintains 
                        order and organization within a schools records, and can make universities and colleges more efficient.
                         There is a lot to oversee in a school with thousands of students. Each needs to be on a specific academic 
                         track and pay certain fees, and an SMS helps schools manage those and many other processes.</p>

                         <br>
                    <p> The value an SMS brings a school depends on how a school decides to use it. There are a lot of different areas 
                        that an SMS can help, including hosting the student enrollment process, making it easy to access academic records, 
                        and having different permission to dictate who can see what. But if schools want to keep certain aspects of their legacy
                         systems, they still can.</p>

                        One of the big determiners of a student’s satisfaction is the enrollment process. This directly impacts student outcomes and
                         can become a major stressor if schools don’t invest the proper resources. Enrollment is an intense time for administrators and 
                         students. Many requirements need to be met for each student, like prerequisite courses, major requirements, and time constraints.
                          This can become a logistical nightmare, and for many students, the entire enrollment process is not a fun one.
